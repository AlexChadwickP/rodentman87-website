# What the heck am I about to read?

For a couple years now I've been working with some... interesting... tech. I've decided to document my ~~pain~~ work here so that others may ~~experience schadenfreude~~ learn from my experience.

## Some background about me

### Who am I?

Hi, my name is Maisy, and I'm a pretty big fan of dinosaurs. You may or may not know me from one of several places, I tend to be in a lot of places all the time.

### How long have I been programming?

I've been programming since I was about 10 or so. I played minecraft at the time and wanted to get into modding the game. I checked out a book about Java from the library and started to learn from there. Beyond a little tinkering I didn't do anything for quite a few years. Around the end of high school I started to get back into programming, this time with a focus more on web development. These days I mostly work in TypeScript. My projects mostly consist of small little websites, discord bots, and some stuff for work that we'll get into throughout this series of blog posts.

### Where the hell do you work that you have to deal with this stuff?

Drumroll please... _the sound of a very tiny snare drum off in the distance plays_. I work in the pet care industry. You're probably thinking one of two things right now:

- "What the hell is going on in the pet care industry?"
- "Oh that explains a lot"

To answer the question: the early 2000s.

## Some background about the tech stack

### What is this legacy application you're using?

A little piece of state-of-the-art software called KennelSuite IX by Plane Software. You wont find much about it because it was last in development around 2006 or so.

### Why are you still using KennelSuite?

Well, to put it in a way that may not get me in trouble in the future: it's the best piece of software on the market in my opinion.

> But I get the impression that you think this software is bad

yes

## Conclusion (kinda)

This post will serve moreso as a reference and I may update it from time to time as I write my other posts
