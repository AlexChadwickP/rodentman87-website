Programming is all about solving problems, so it's important to have a good framework to follow to solve those problems in a way that's easy to understand and think about. To do this, let's work through an example problem together. Let's say you have a bunch of blocks that you want to sort by size.

## Step 1: Understand what you're given

The very first thing you should do is look at everything you're given, not just the data, but what tools you have at your disposal. In our example, we're given some data in the form of a group of blocks, for each of these blocks, we also know how tall they are. Beyond that we'll assume that the only other tools we have are
